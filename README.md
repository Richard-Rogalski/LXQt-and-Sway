# LXQt-and-Sway!

This is a guide on how to get LXQt/LXQt components (such as the panel) working with Sway. If you use another wayland compositor, you're out of luck in this guide for things like getting the dock on an edge of your screen and not having windows overlap it. You are (probably) in luck if you want it to quit segfaulting and get it visible on your screen (at least with wlroots based compositors, no promises otherwise)

### What *Won't* work (as of LXQt 1.0)
